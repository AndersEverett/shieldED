#Code Review MVP

## Git
consider cleaning up merge messages (`amend`)

## UI
Some homepage directions
Some login directions - around key, anonymous login etc.
Who's the perp - remove

Be sure to implement roles
Will there be parent use separate than student use?


## Tests
* Jasmine testing!  use jasmine/rails gem
* Lots more controller tests
